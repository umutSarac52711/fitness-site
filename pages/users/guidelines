Extra points to include for Users CRUD

-Passwords:
    Never show or store raw. In add.php (or when resetting) run password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT). In list / edit pages do not print the hash; just a “Reset password” button that leads to a separate form.

-Role field:	
    Dropdown → member / admin. In edit.php block an admin from demoting themselves (if ($id == $_SESSION['user']['id']) …).

-Soft-delete:
    Instead of DELETE, add is_active TINYINT(1); list shows inactive users greyed-out. (already done)
    Have a deactivate.php instead of delete.php. It should set is_active = 0 and redirect to list.php.

-Email uniqueness:
    In add.php/edit.php catch duplicate email error and show a bootstrap alert.

-Pagination / search:
	Users tables can grow; add a simple “search by email” GET filter and a LIMIT 25 OFFSET … pager if you have time.

-Audit safety:
	Log changes (updated_at, updated_by). Even one line in SQL helps you trace who altered roles.


Differences between
    -Plans	                 |   Users
    -Simple numeric fields	 |   Sensitive data (passwords, roles)
    -Anyone can view list	 |   Only admins should reach users/*
    -Delete row safely	     |   Prefer deactivate unless you truly purge
